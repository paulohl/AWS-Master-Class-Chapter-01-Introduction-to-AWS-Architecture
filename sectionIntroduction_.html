<h1 data-label="introduction-to-aws" class="ltx_title_section">Introduction to AWS</h1><div>In the vast landscape of cloud computing, AWS stands as a formidable
titan, shaping the digital evolution of businesses and individuals
alike. To embark on our journey into AWS architecture in this chapter of
the book, it is crucial to contextualize its emergence and ascendancy.
Founded by <b>Amazon.com</b> in 2006, AWS swiftly transcended its
initial identity as a humble cloud computing experiment to become the
unrivaled leader in cloud technology [2]. Its meteoric rise was
propelled by the visionary leadership of Amazon’s <i>Jeff Bezos</i> , who
recognized the potential for providing businesses with scalable
computing resources, transforming IT infrastructure into a utility
accessible to anyone, anywhere [3].
AWS’s influence is global in scope, with a pervasive presence across
multiple continents. The infrastructure underpinning AWS is a
masterpiece of engineering, consisting of a network of data centers
strategically distributed across regions and availability zones. This
global reach not only ensures low-latency access to services but also
provides redundancy and fault tolerance, which are paramount in today’s
digital landscape. With a customer base that spans startups,
enterprises, governments, and individuals, AWS has democratized access
to cutting-edge technology. It is the bedrock for countless innovations,
ranging from web startups to scientific research, underlining its
adaptability to a vast array of use cases.
Understanding AWS’s historical trajectory and the sheer scale of its
customer base and infrastructure is essential as we explore AWS
architecture. These foundational aspects set the stage for comprehending
the technical intricacies and architectural principles that will follow
in subsequent sections of this chapter.</div>
