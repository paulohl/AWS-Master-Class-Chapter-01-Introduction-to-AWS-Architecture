<h1 data-label="cost-optimization" class="ltx_title_section">Cost optimization</h1><div>In the dynamic landscape of cloud computing, cost optimization stands as
a fundamental pillar of AWS architecture. This section explores the
essential strategies for managing and optimizing AWS costs, shedding
light on how organizations can harness tools like AWS Trusted Advisor
and cost allocation tags [30] to achieve financial efficiency while
maximizing the value derived from cloud investments.
Cost optimization in AWS is not just a desire but a strategic necessity.
AWS recognizes the significance of this aspect and offers a suite of
tools and best practices to assist organizations in controlling costs
effectively. AWS Trusted Advisor, for instance, is a powerful tool that
inspects an organization’s AWS environment and provides real-time,
personalized recommendations for optimizing costs, enhancing system
performance, and improving security. It evaluates various aspects of an
AWS infrastructure, including idle resources, underutilized instances,
and opportunities for rightsizing, helping organizations make informed
decisions that align with their financial objectives [31].
Furthermore, cost allocation tags enable businesses to categorize and
track spending by resource, project, department, or any other relevant
dimension. By applying cost allocation tags to AWS resources,
organizations gain granular visibility into their cost structures,
enabling them to identify areas of overspending and allocate costs
accurately among teams and projects [32]. Refer to the following
