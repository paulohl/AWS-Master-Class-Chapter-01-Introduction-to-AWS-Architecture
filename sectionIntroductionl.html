<h1 data-label="introduction-1" class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div>In the ever-evolving landscape of cloud computing, <b>Amazon Web
Services (AWS)</b> stands as a towering pillar of innovation and
transformation. As we embark on our journey into the world of AWS
architecture in the first chapter of this book, we step into a realm
where cloud technology redefines possibilities.
AWS, officially launched by Amazon in 2006, has grown into the world’s
most comprehensive and widely adopted cloud platform, serving millions
of customers across the globe. However, the roots of AWS extend back to
the early 2000s when Amazon sought to streamline its internal operations
and scale its engineering efforts. The company’s transition to
service-oriented architecture laid the groundwork for what would become
AWS. Early initiatives focused on addressing internal challenges, such
as speeding up software engineering and reducing the burden of IT
infrastructure. By 2002 [1], Amazon had launched its first web
services, which allowed developers to build on its platform.
Over the next few years, key infrastructure components such as compute,
storage, and databases were identified as essential building blocks for
broader cloud services. This led to the eventual development of Amazon
EC2 and S3, which were launched in 2006, marking the official
introduction of AWS as a public cloud service. These early services were
designed to help developers avoid the complexities of managing storage
and computing resources, allowing them to focus on innovation. AWS has
since expanded into a vast ecosystem of services, cementing its role as
a leader in cloud computing.</div>
