<h1 data-label="security-and-identity" class="ltx_title_section">Security and identity</h1><div>In the realm of cloud computing, security is paramount, and AWS sets the
gold standard with its comprehensive suite of security mechanisms. This
section delves into the world of AWS’s robust security and identity
features, closely examining pivotal tools such as <b>Identity and
Access Management</b> (<b>IAM</b> ) and <b>Web Application Firewall</b> (<b>WAF</b> ). These components are the sentinels that guard your AWS
resources, ensuring they remain protected in the ever-evolving threat
landscape.
IAM is the linchpin of AWS security. It provides a centralized and
fine-grained control system for managing user access to AWS resources.
It enables organizations to create and manage user identities, assign
permissions, and configure authentication and authorization policies.
With IAM, businesses can ensure that users and applications have the
right access level, minimizing the risk of unauthorized actions or data
breaches. IAM’s flexibility extends to <b>Multi-Factor
Authentication</b> (<b>MFA</b> ), identity federation, and integration
with other AWS services. As a result, it empowers organizations to
adhere to the principle of least privilege, an essential security best
practice, while fostering collaboration and resource sharing within the
AWS environment [19]. Refer to the following figure:</div>
