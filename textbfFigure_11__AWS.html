locations. These centers are strategically placed in regions worldwide
to meet the needs of a global customer base. By offering regions on
multiple continents, AWS ensures that users can deploy their
applications and services close to their end-users, reducing latency and
enhancing the user experience. This strategic distribution of data
centers is not only about proximity but also about regulatory
compliance. It allows organizations to adhere to data sovereignty
requirements by storing data within specific geographic boundaries.
Whether you are a startup targeting local markets or a multinational
corporation with a global presence, AWS’s global infrastructure paves
the way for reliability, scalability, and low-latency access, making it
a cornerstone of modern cloud architecture [5].</div>
