application attacks. WAF is a managed firewall service that enables
organizations to create custom security rules, inspect incoming web
traffic, and protect against common threats such as SQL injection and<b>Cross-Site Scripting</b> (<b>XSS</b> ) attacks. By integrating WAF
with AWS resources, such as Amazon CloudFront and Application Load
Balancers, businesses can create a secure front line for their
applications, ensuring that malicious traffic is identified and blocked
before it reaches their infrastructure [20].</div><div>Security is a cornerstone of AWS’s design philosophy, and IAM and WAF
are integral to its commitment to safeguarding customer data and
resources. As we progress, we will explore these security mechanisms in
greater detail, uncovering advanced strategies, best practices, and
real-world scenarios that demonstrate how AWS’s security and identity
features can be harnessed to protect your cloud assets effectively.</div>
