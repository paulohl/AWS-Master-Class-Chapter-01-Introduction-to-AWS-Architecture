RDS and Amazon DynamoDB, that incorporate scalability by design. These
services automatically handle database replication, failover, and
resource provisioning to ensure that databases can scale seamlessly with
application demands. This approach enables organizations to focus on
building applications without the operational overhead of managing
database scalability manually [23]. In the chapters ahead, we will
delve deeper into these services, exploring strategies and best
practices for optimizing scalability and elasticity in your AWS
architecture. As we uncover these principles, you will gain the
knowledge and skills needed to build efficient, responsive, and
cost-effective cloud-based solutions.</div>
