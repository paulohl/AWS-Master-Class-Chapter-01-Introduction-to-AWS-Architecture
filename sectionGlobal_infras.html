<h1 data-label="global-infrastructure" class="ltx_title_section">Global infrastructure</h1><div>In the ever-expanding realm of cloud computing, the foundation upon
which a cloud provider’s services are built is nothing short of
critical. AWS, in its quest to deliver unparalleled performance,
resilience, and scalability, has meticulously crafted a global
infrastructure that stands as a testament to technological innovation.
In this section, we delve into the intricacies of AWS’s global
infrastructure, revealing the strategic placement of data centers across
the world, the concept of regions and availability zones, and the
profound impact this architecture has on ensuring the reliability and
low-latency access that is essential in today’s digital landscape.
AWS’s global infrastructure is the backbone of its service offerings,
and it has been strategically designed to cater to customers’ diverse
needs around the globe. At the heart of this infrastructure are AWS
regions, geographical areas comprising multiple <b>Availability
Zones</b> (<b>AZs</b> ). Each region is designed to be isolated from
others, providing redundancy and failover capabilities. This
geographical dispersion minimizes the risk of service interruptions due
to natural disasters or unforeseen events. Within each region, there are
multiple AZs, which are essentially data centers with independent power,
cooling, and network connectivity. These AZs are interconnected through
low-latency, high-throughput links, enabling synchronous data
replication and ensuring high availability. This architecture is
fundamental to achieving the resiliency and fault tolerance that modern
applications demand [4]. Refer to the following figure:</div>
