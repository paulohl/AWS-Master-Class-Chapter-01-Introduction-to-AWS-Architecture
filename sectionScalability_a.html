<h1 data-label="scalability-and-elasticity" class="ltx_title_section">Scalability and elasticity</h1><div>In cloud computing, the ability to seamlessly scale and adapt to
fluctuating workloads is a hallmark of efficiency and
cost-effectiveness. AWS champions this concept with a suite of services
and features designed to provide scalability and elasticity. In this
section, we delve into the mechanics of AWS’s approach, understanding
how it enables automatic scaling and resource optimization to handle
variable workloads with unparalleled efficiency.
At the core of AWS’s scalability and elasticity is the notion that
computing resources should align precisely with demand. <b>Elastic
Load Balancing</b> (<b>ELB</b> ) is one of the fundamental AWS services
that facilitates this alignment. ELB automatically distributes incoming
application traffic across multiple Amazon EC2 instances, ensuring no
single instance becomes a bottleneck. As traffic fluctuates, ELB
dynamically scales the number of instances to accommodate changes in
demand, effectively distributing the load and optimizing application
performance [21]. Moreover, AWS Auto Scaling takes this concept to
the next level. With Auto Scaling, organizations can define scaling
policies based on predefined conditions, such as CPU utilization or
network traffic. When these conditions are met, Auto Scaling
automatically adds or removes instances to match the desired capacity,
ensuring that resources are efficiently utilized without manual
intervention. This capability is particularly valuable for handling
variable workloads, such as e-commerce websites experiencing traffic
spikes during sales events or gaming applications during peak gaming
hours [22].
