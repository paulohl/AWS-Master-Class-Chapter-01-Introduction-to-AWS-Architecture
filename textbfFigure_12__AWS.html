<div><b>Figure 1.2</b> : AWS Regions and Zones</div><div>(<b>Source</b> : AWS Disaster Recovery Workshop)</div><div>AWS defines a region as a geographically distinct area where AWS
resources are available. Each region operates independently,
encompassing multiple data centers, making it highly resistant to
regional disruptions. For example, the AWS US East (N. Virginia) region
is separate from the AWS EU (Ireland) region. These regions are
strategically located worldwide, enabling AWS users to deploy resources
in proximity to their target audience or to adhere to data residency and
compliance requirements. This geographical diversity empowers
organizations to architect their systems for redundancy, failover, and
low-latency access, all while benefiting from AWS’s extensive global
network infrastructure [4].</div><div>Within each AWS region, the concept of AZs comes into play. It is
essentially a data center, but AWS goes the extra mile by ensuring that
these AZs are isolated from one another. They have power, cooling, and
network connectivity, minimizing the risk of correlated failures. These
AZs are interconnected through a network designed for low-latency,
high-throughput communication, allowing for synchronous data replication
and providing the foundation for achieving high availability. By
distributing resources across multiple AZs, AWS users can architect
their applications and systems to withstand failures, ensuring that even
in the face of unexpected events, services remain available, and data
remains secure. The combination of regions and AZs exemplifies AWS’s
commitment to delivering robust and resilient cloud infrastructure
