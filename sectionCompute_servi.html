<h1 data-label="compute-services" class="ltx_title_section">Compute services</h1><div>In the dynamic landscape of cloud computing, AWS’s prowess truly shines
in its comprehensive suite of compute services, each designed to serve
as a foundational building block for a wide array of applications and
workloads. This section of the chapter offers a comprehensive
exploration of AWS’s compute services, providing a nuanced understanding
of their unique capabilities and highlighting their pivotal role in
building scalable and versatile cloud-based applications.
EC2 stands as one of the cornerstones of AWS’s compute offerings. It
provides resizable virtual servers, known as instances, allowing users
to quickly scale up or down based on their computing needs. With EC2,
organizations can deploy applications, host websites, and manage
workloads with precision and flexibility. EC2 instances come in various
configurations, including compute-optimized, memory-optimized, and
storage-optimized, catering to a wide range of computational
requirements [11]. Furthermore, AWS Lambda, a serverless computing
service, represents a paradigm shift in application development. Lambda
enables developers to run code in response to events without the need to
manage servers, automatically scaling based on incoming requests. This
serverless approach simplifies application development, reduces
operational overhead, and accelerates time to market [12]. In
addition, the ECS empowers organizations to manage and orchestrate
containerized applications effortlessly. Whether using Docker containers
or AWS Fargate for serverless containers, ECS streamlines the deployment
and scaling of containerized workloads, making it an ideal choice for
modern application architectures [13]. Refer to the following
